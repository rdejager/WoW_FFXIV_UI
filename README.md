FFXIV inspired UI for WoW retail mostly, With WeakAura's

**I am in the works for a classic version also. Changed the most importand WA's  Still need to get up a guide on how to setup the needed addons and settings.**

This is my UI pack for WoW. I only play retail so I know it works there. My resolution is 1080P

I Also included different fonts in the pack, for me its more readable.

**Needed addons to download:**

Masque: For skinnin the buttons

Masque Blizzard Bars: To allow skinning the blizz actionbars

oUF_KarUI: invisible unit frames to make WA's clickable & moveable (made LUA eddit to make it work with this UI, see below)

Blizz UI Import string: https://github.com/rdejager/WoW_FFXIV_UI/blob/main/BlizzUI%20Import.md


After all the addons are downloaded and the wa's & blizz UI imported. Extract the downloaded zip from Github. Keep the folder layout and replace the oUF_karUI Lua file when asked. If done correctly when you restart the game you should see the target of target arrow, and the full frames are selectable. 

To move the unit frames you do /kmf  This opens the moveUI of oUF_karUI. The WA's are linked to that. Once you moved a frame you can change the position more precise in the interface options, then addons, oUF_KarUI.
If you change the Scale the unit frames will change in size. I keep them at 1.0 


**Skin buttons:** open /masque here you can change the blizzard Action Bars & WeakAuras to FFXIV. Disable backdrop and enable gloss. Rest is personal prefference.

**Plater:** Still in progress


**oUF_KarUI INFO!!**

If you already installed the UI but only want the updated oUF_KarUI LUA edit. See below

Rightclick, save as. Then copy over the original in the Interface/Addons/oUF_KarUI folder
